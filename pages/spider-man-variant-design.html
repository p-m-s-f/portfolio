<p><em>In your opinion, what makes a good spider-variant design? I'm trying to avoid the pitfall of "bunch of normal ass clothes over the suit" I typically see, but also struggling to come up with anything that's clearly a spider-man when you look at it and doesn't confuse with peter parker's spider-man</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>That's a good question! So good that I'm going to bust out the proper capitalization and everything.</p>
<p>I'll give you a freebie right off the bat, because this is probably going to be a long post: one easy way to distinguish your character from Peter Parker is to draw them with a different body type. That way, even if their costume was similar to Peter's, it would obviously not be him.</p>
<p>Now, before getting into what I think makes a good Spider-Man design, I feel obligated to speak on what makes a good <em>superhero</em> design. Namely: <strong>keep it simple, stupid!</strong> The best superhero costumes are pretty easy to draw, probably because they were designed to be drawn a million times by a million different artists. These costumes are simple enough that they can reduced to bands of colour and stay recognizable.</p>
<p><img alt="A drawing of a kid on their bed reading a comic, in silhouette. They're imagining Batman and The Hulk as horizontal bands of colour." src="/pages/colours.gif"></p>
<p>I promise that keeping your design simple will undoubtedly make it better-- or at least more superheroic, because this applies to Spider-Man, too!</p>
<p>Onto making a Spider-Man costume that is recognizably Spider-Man, but clearly not Peter Parker's. Obviously this costume is going to look different than Peter's classic costume, so we could start by figuring out what about that costume we <em>can</em> change. Thankfully, they already stripped Spider-Man down to the essentials in 1984.</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram with two drawings of Spider-Man: Spider-Man in his classic, red-and-blue suit, drawn by Steve Ditko, and Spider-Man in his black suit, drawn by Mike Zeck." src="/pages/spider-mans.png"></p>
<p>Mike Zeck's black costume identifies these necessary elements of Spider-Man's costume:</p>
<ul>
<li>Those luchador eyes</li>
<li>The front and back spider emblem</li>
<li>Form-fitting tights</li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the costume (the segmented colours, the web pattern, etc.) are basically fine for you to ignore or change at your leisure. Okay, maybe not... you could just draw Green Lantern and put a spider on his chest and back, and that probably wouldn't make for a great Spider-Man. But, it's a place to start at least. As long as you're putting serious thought into this costume, though, you should be able to ignore pitfalls like that.</p>
<p>Hey, speaking of thought, I thought I should cover some of those extraneous details Ditko included in his iconic Spider-Man design! Namely the way he chose to segment the reds and blues, he actually put loads of thought into it:</p>
<p><img alt="A diagram of Spider-Man's costume, by Ditko/Lee" src="/pages/costume-logistics.png"></p>
<p>Namely, the high-rise gloves and boots help Peter's costume remain invisible beneath his civvies. I actually think these logistics are important to consider when designing a Spider-Man costume (or really any costume).</p>
<p>Anon mentions the "bunch of normal ass clothes over the suit" trend in spider-design in their ask, which I was happy to see because it means I can talk about something that really bugs me about recent Spider-Man stuff: <strong>how does Spider-Man stick to walls through regular shoes?</strong> No, seriously? Think about it for a second! When Miles wears Jordans over his Spider-Man costume and tries to stick his feet to a wall, wouldn't his feet just stick to his shoes instead?</p>
<p>Ditko rationalized this by deciding that Spider-Man can stick to walls through thin fabrics, but that rule has basically been forgotten. Despite how I sound, I'm mostly fine with this change (this is a textbook 'rule of cool' case), but these kinds of things are worth thinking about.</p>
<p>In that vein, keep in mind that Spider-Man's superpowers really lend themselves to acrobatics. Your spider-character probably shouldn't be wearing a suit of armour, or something that would greatly restrict their movement or sticking ability. That's why I labelled "Form-fitting tights" as a necessary characteristic of a Spider-Man costume earlier on in this post.</p>
<p>Before I wrap this up, one more thing you can try doing if you're stumped is looking at real life for inspiration. Whether that's going back to the old strongman outfits that gave way to the original superhero costumes, looking at modern day equivalent athletic wear, or even looking at actual fashion (as long as you're not just putting that fashion over the suit), there's bound to be something that could give you ideas.</p>
