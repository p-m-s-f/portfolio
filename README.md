## So what's the deal with this thing, anyways?

Last year, I created a portfolio website to apply for internships at Disney and Pixar. It was a crude piece of work, cobbled together in Bluehost's file manager.
Neither studio expressed interest in my applications, but I discovered web design was rewarding on its own.

Later in the same year, I was introduced to a more conventional workflow using static site generators and Git. This is my attempt at creating a portfolio site using similar web design techniques.
